I have to thank to Milan Wudia for his seemless support till his
sudden death after short and dreadful disease. He was more than just
a sole of this project, he was our friend and a fair fellow. Everybody
of us miss him.

I owe a lot to my tutor and friend Peter Fabo, who introduced me
wonderful world of Java(TM) and helped me to pass through the major
problems.

I dedicate this little piece of software to Zuzana Fischerova, who
gave me bottomless source of power and inspiration.  Thanks a lot
Zuzi.
