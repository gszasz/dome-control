The following document contains the basic definition and hierarchy of
parameters used for dome tracking and also some hints how to measure
or estimate these parameters.  You can also find there list of

0. Definitions
==============

0.1 Definition of Observatory Coordinates
-----------------------------------------

  * Longitude [deg]: Angular distance of the observatory location from
    the Greenwitch meridian.  The longitude is positive to the west
    and negative to the east.

  * Latitude [deg]: Angular distance of the observatory location from
    the equator.  The latitude is positive to the north and negative
    to the south.


0.2 Definition of Dome Parameters
---------------------------------

  * Wall Height [m]: Height of the dome building wall relative to the
    floor.  The boundary between the wall and the dome is not usually
    well defined and it is the field for some experiments.  Ideal Wall
    Height is equal to distance from the center of the floor to the
    <geometric> center of sphere fitting inner surface of the dome.

  * Dome Radius [m]: Half of the dome <inbound diameter>.  This is the
    radius of sphere fitting inner surface of the dome.  Do not use
    the factory value of dome diameter to calculate this parameter.
    Try to do several measurements and use the mean value.

  * Slit Width [m]: Linear distance between vertical slit boundaries,
    which is usually the same for all heights.  Feel free to use the
    real value in this point.  Treshold to calibrate minimal
    approach to the slit boundaries is handled by another parameter.

  * Slit Depth [m]: This parameter is handled as diference of radii of
    spheres fitting inner and outer dome surfaces.  There is no exact
    way how to measure this parameter, however, you can do the rough
    estimate according to the measurements of the linear slit
    thickness.  Feel free to experiment.

0.3 Definition of Mount Parameters
----------------------------------

  * Excentric Distance [m]: Deflection of the leg position relative to
    the center of floor in north-south axis (positive to the south).

  * Leg Axis Length [m]: Lenth of the vertical leg axis from the floor
    to its <geometric> intersection with polar axis.

  * Polar Axis Length [m]: Length of the polar axis from its
    <geometric> intersection with leg axis up to its <geometric>
    intersection with declination axis.

  * Declination Axis Length [m]: Length of the declination from its
    <geometric> intersection with polar axis up to its <geometric>
    intersection with optical axis of the major telescope.

0.4 Definition of Telescope Parameters
--------------------------------------

  * Scope Diameter [m]: Diameter of the telescope aperture.

  * Scope Offset [m]: Perpendicular distance between optical axis of
    the major telescope and the optical axis of the attached
    telescope.

  * Scope Position Angle [deg]: Angular position of the attached
    telescope relative to the declination axis, measured clockwise.
    In doubt see following scheme:

      Scheme of Scope Position Angle:

                   90      (viewed from telescope <entrance> aperture)
                 __|__
                /     \  180
             0-|   o   |========= declination axis

                   |  
                  270


0.5 Definition of Tracking Parameters
-------------------------------------

  * Sensor Count: Number of "virtual sensors" used for numerical
    calculation of the intersection between dome sphere and the
    telescope aperture.  This number affect the precision of Optimal
    Tracking Mode.

  * Tracking Delay [s]: Interval between two computations of dome
    position (in seconds).  Set this parameter to the large value, if
    you want to save CPU time and mechanical parts of the dome.

  * Slit Boundary Treshold [m]: Maximum linear distance of aproach to
    the intersection to slit boundary.  This parameter is important
    for "Optimized Tracking Mode".

  * Tracking Mode: Algorithm used for dome tracking.

      - Follow Object: The simplest algorithm.  Setting center of slit
        to the actual object azimuth.

      - Follow Scope: Setting centrum of slit to the center of
        calculated intersection.

      - Optimized: The most sophisticated algorithm.  If the
        intersection has passed through slit center and gets close to
        one of the slit boundaries, the algorithm moves the slit to
        the position in which the opposite slit boundary is close to
        the intersection.  If intersection reaches slit boundary
        without passing the center first, the slit is set to the
        center of the intersection.  This behavior prevents "bouncy"
        dome moves in case if the intersection moves almost
        along the slit.  If the intersection approaches to the slit
        boundary in the zenith area, slit is moved to the azimuth of
        the touch point.  If part of the intersection is below
        horizon, the dome is not moved at all.  This algorithm was
        developed to minimize dome movements during observation, in
        order to save mechanical parts of the dome.
