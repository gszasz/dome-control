0.1 Java(TM) Platform
--------------------- 
Dome Control is written for Java(TM) platform.  It was tested using
Java Standard Edition 1.4.2, but feel free to use newer version of
JavaSE.  Be sure you are using original Java SE from Sun Microsystems,
otherwise we cannot ensure compatibility of all used classes.  You can
download JavaSE Packages for free from:

  http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads

Note that you need to install JavaSE SDK, if you want to compile Dome
Control from source code.  Otherwise download the JavaSE JRE (Java
Runtime Environment).

0.1 Java3D API
-------------- 
Dome Control uses special classes for 3D graphics which are not part
of the JavaSE.  You have to download and install Java3D API.  This
package is available for free at:

  http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/3D/downloads

Dome Control has been tested with Java3D API 1.4.2, but it is supposed
to work with newer version as well.


1. Instalation from binary package
==================================

1.1 UNIX/Linux
--------------

1. Convince yourself that JavaSE JRE (or SDK) is properly installed in
   your system and its version is 1.4.2 or higher.  If you are using
   one of the Linux distributions or Solaris(TM), the JavaSE should be
   already installed.  Type "java -version" in console and you should
   get something like this:

   ---
   java version "1.4.2_01"
   Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.4.2_01-b06)
   Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.4.2_01-b06, mixed mode)
   ---

   If not, try to download and install newest version of JavaSE from
   website mentioned in chapter 0.1.

2. Download and install Java3D API from website mentioned in chapter 0.2.

3. Unpack the DomeControl.zip archive.

4. Change to unpacked directory and try following command:

   java -jar DomeControl.jar

   If both, JavaSE JRE and Java3D API were installed properly, this
   command should launch Dome Control application.

5. If you want to access Dome Control globally, install it to your
   system with following command (as root):

   make install

6. After this, you can launch Dome Control from any location typing:

   DomeControl


1.2 MS Windows
--------------

1. Download and install JavaSE JRE (or SDK) from the website mentioned
   in chapter 0.1.

2. Download and install Java3D API from website mentioned in chapter 0.2.

3. Unpack DomeControl.zip archive.

4. Run MS DOS Prompt (in Windows 95/98/Me) or cmd (in Windows
   NT/2000/XP), change to the unpacked directory and type following
   command:

   java -jar DomeControl.jar

   If both, JavaSE JRE and Java3D API were installed properly, this
   command should launch Dome Control.

5. To access DomeControl globally, create folder:

   C:\Program Files\DomeControl

   and copy there files "DomeControl.jar" and "DomeControl.ico".

6. Create new Shortcut with following parameters:

   * Target:

      "C:\Program Files\Java\j2re-1.4.2_11\bin\javaw.exe" -jar DomeControl.jar

     Warning! Exact target depends on JavaSE version and location.
     This example is valid for JavaSE Runtime Environment 1.4.2-11.

   * Run in:

      "C:\Program Files\DomeControl"

   * Icon: 

       "C:\Program Files\DomeControl\DomeControl.ico"


7. Run Dome Control clicking on the created shortcut.


2. Installation from Source Code
================================

2.1 UNIX/Linux
--------------

1. Convince yourself that JavaSE SDK is properly installed in your
   system and its version is 1.4.2 or higher.  If you are using one of
   the Linux distributions or Solaris(TM), it is possible that JavaSE
   SDK is already installed.  If not, try to download and install
   newest version from website mentioned in chapter 0.1.

2. Download and install Java3D API from website mentioned in chapter
   0.2.

3. Unpack file DomeControl-src.zip.

4. Change to the unpacked directory and type command:

   make

5. If there is no error, try to run following command:

   java -jar src/DomeControl.jar

   If both, JavaSE SDK and Java3D API were installed properly, this
   command should launch Dome Control window.

6. To install compiled Dome Control to the system, type (as root):

   make install

7. Now you can execute Dome Control from anywhere with command:

   DomeControl


2.2 MS Windows
--------------

1. Download and install JavaSE SDK from the website mentioned in
   chapter 0.1.

2. Download and install Java3D API from website mentioned in chapter 0.2.

3. Unpack file DomeControl-src.zip.

4. Run MS DOS Prompt (in Windows 95/98/Me) or cmd (in Windows
   NT/2000/XP), change to the unpacked directory and type following
   commands:

   cd src
   javac *.java
   jar cmf mainClass DomeControl.jar *.class

5. Now you can run Dome Control directly typing command:

   java -jar DomeControl.jar 

6. To install Dome Control to system, create folder:

   C:\Program Files\DomeControl

7. Copy files: 

     src\catalog.dat         src\DomeControl.jar
     src\customProperties    icons\DomeControl.ico
     src\defaultProperties

   to created folder "C:\Program Files\DomeControl".

8. Create new Shortcut with following parameters:

   * Target:

      "C:\Program Files\Java\j2re-1.4.2_11\bin\javaw.exe" -jar DomeControl.jar

     Warning! Exact target depends on JavaSE version and location.
     This example is valid for JavaSE Runtime Environment 1.4.2-11.

   * Run in:

      "C:\Program Files\DomeControl"

   * Icon: 

       "C:\Program Files\DomeControl\DomeControl.ico"


9. Run Dome Control clicking on the created shortcut.
